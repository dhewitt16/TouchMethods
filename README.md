# Dynamic Touch Processing Pipelines for EEG Data

This repo contains analysis pipelines for processing EEG data for dynamic, stroking touch stimuli. Two approaches are used: event-related potentials following the offset of touch stimuli, and time-frequency analysis of cortical oscillations in the anticipation of, during, and immediately after touch.

Analysis is carried out using MATLAB (v2025) with EEGLAB (v2022/2023, https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download.php) and FieldTrip (v2024, https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/download/) packages. Bar graphs are plotted using Jupyter Notebooks.
